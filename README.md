Level & Concept Design:

To understand how we made this game you must first understand that the three contributing factors to our success: Caffeine, white boards, and pizza. Without these three key concepts we would not have the game we have now. And that’s about it from me….. I don’t know what else to say but you can always send us questions before you do though here are a few rules for asking questions:

1.    They are not on our nonexistent FAQ on our nonexistent website, we will just assume that you have innate knowledge one what questions have been asked.
2.    If you do have innate knowledge of the universe and its happenings don’t ask questions because you already know the answers.
3.    Don’t ask questions because you can’t be sure you haven’t broken one of the rules listed above

So! If you follow the simple rules above your question asking experience will be quick and painless! Enjoy your day
