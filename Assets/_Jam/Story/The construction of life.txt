The story begins with all of the charicters walking up a mounton. The mounton is very tall and has a 
budda temple at the top. Clueless walks into the temple and sees a large, red button. He presses it 
and sends them all into a land of floating islands.

Whiteboard starts thinking. A text buble pops up with a "..." in it. He Whiteboard then erases the
"..." and starts to wright on the buble. Whiteboard starts to draw a house with elaberate plans
Bruce comes over and erases the Whiteboards pland and start's to draw his own. Meanwhile Clueless
starts chasing a bird and finds a cave. The others see the cave and start walking twords it. when
Clueless comes back out he trips and falls on his face. The others walk on him to get into the cave.

When they all wake up Whiteboard and Bruce are agruing about how they will biuld a house. Ginger
comes over and points out to them that there is anouther island and that they should try to get to it.

They have Clueless find a rope and pass it down so everyone else can get up. Clueless turns around and
sees a big pile of food and gold on a platform with wheels. He touches it and it falls off the island.
Every looks at Clueless in rage. They quickly start to set up camp. Whiteboard starts to plan out how
they are going to get food. Clueless looks depressingly off the edge of the island as it starts to rain.
Jams comes over and draws an umbrella on Whiteboard's speech buble and places it over Clueless. Once camp
is set up they all head to sleep. Once day rizes it starts to give the ilussion that the player is in control
but quickly stops as Bruce points at the new hunger meater. Whiteboard explains what the hunger bar does
and the player is in control.
